#Data structure

#problem

Sometimes you get api responses that may not be in the structure you want. But you have to use it
anyway.
Suppose you got a response like the one given below. Write a code to transform the following response
object to the given object named tableData.
Response: https://gist.github.com/nayeem101/f2aeb547f469307158dc79b5859dc1f3
Transform the Response object to the given tableData structure using javascript or typescript.
